Here are examples used in my presentation at JRubyKaigi 2010. The title was "Want To Use Ruby From Java? RedBridge Makes It Pretty Easy!" You can see my slide at

The slide itself was a demo built on Google App Engine using JRuby on Rails.

When you run Java code, try below.

  mvn install
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="evergreen.HelloWorld"
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="evergreen.JirbSwing"
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="evergreen.InterfaceImpl"


When you run Clojure code which uses DataMapper library, please read clojure/README.
